<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Biometry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical biometry is categorized into contact and non-contact types based on their measurement techniques. Contact type optical biometry involves direct contact with the eye, often utilizing devices like ultrasound or lens-based systems to measure ocular parameters. In contrast, non-contact type employs methods that do not touch the eye, using light reflections or imaging techniques, providing a more comfortable experience for patients. Both types are essential in ophthalmology for precise assessments during procedures like cataract surgery and refractive surgery.</p></p>
