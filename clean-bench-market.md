<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Clean Bench Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Flow Clean Bench</li><li>Horizontal Flow Clean Bench</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Clean benches are crucial in environments requiring contamination control, primarily used in laboratories and industrial settings. Vertical flow clean benches disperse air downward from a HEPA filter, providing protection for sensitive experiments while ensuring minimal contamination. In contrast, horizontal flow clean benches direct airflow horizontally across the workspace, also using HEPA filtration. Both types serve distinct purposes, catering to specific application needs, with vertical benches often preferred for larger equipment and horizontal benches suited for manual tasks or smaller setups.</p></p>
